# Web Scraping Google Search Results

There are three different versions of codes where all three of them serve to acquire and store the number of search results obtained from self-generated google queries. To be more specific, the queries are clauses in the form of "I am [adjective] because I [verb]", while the adjectives and verbs come from adjectives.txt and verbs.txt. The number of search results are then stored in respective results.txt files.
